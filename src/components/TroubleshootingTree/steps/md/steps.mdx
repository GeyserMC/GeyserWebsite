Are you hosting a Geyser instance yourself?

You should click "Yes" if you...:
- ...own and operate a Minecraft: Java edition server with the Geyser plugin/mod installed.
- ...have a Geyser-Standalone / Geyser-ViaProxy instance set up to connect to other servers.
- ...use any variant of Geyser on any supported platform.

If you are NOT hosting your own Geyser instance or server - and are intead connecting to someone's server -
then please contact the server administrator for help.

1. Toubleshooting start 

Self hosting vs minecraft server hosting provider

"""
Hosting provider:
Select this option if you are using a Minecraft server hosting provider that
provides you with a Minecraft server.

Self-Hosted @ home:
Select this option if you are hosting on your own Windows/Linux/MacOS computer,
server located at your location.

Self-Hosted @ nothome:
Applies for KVM/VPS/Bare-Metal servers (and similar) that are not located at your location.
"""

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hosting provider:

1. Select provider (dropdown w. search / not listed)

Non-Listed:
- recommend clone-remote-port, do basic dump checks for bad options/system properties
- pls contact host!

"""
We unfortunately do not have instructions available for the server hosting provider you're using.

However, we recommend trying these configurations:

1. Runnning Geyser on the Java server port

- Open the Geyser configuration, and set `clone-remote-port` to `true`. Then, save the changes, and restart the server.

- Verify connecting works:
    -> directly connect with the java server ip and port
    or
    -> connectiontest command

If none of these options work, please contact your server hosting provider for help on how to set up Geyser.

"""

Listed:
- geyser dump 
    -> configuration check (match with instructions???)
    -> bad options: proxy protocol; remote address
    -> check for system properties

- options:
    -> re-ask for a geyser dump (verify correct changes)
    -> still not working; continue troubleshooting
        -> errors in log?
        -> else: contact host pls
    -> works now -> send to feedback page?

OR: unable to get dump
    -> is server running? log???

    Options:
    -> addr. in use -> show setup steps
    -> port in use (-> check for voice plugins/query???)
    -> startup errors -> join discord/open github issue
    -> ...

IF server running/config correct:
-> ensure connection to proper ip/port
-> contact server hosting provider for help
-> join discord if unclear
