# Commands and Permissions

Geyser features many built-in commands that can be used by players or server owners.

:::info

When using BungeeCord and Velocity, you will need to use a permission plugin such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/)
on the proxy server to assign permissions to players. Assigning permissions on the backend servers will not work.

## Permissions when using Geyser-Standalone/Geyser-ViaProxy {#standalone-viaproxy-permissions}
Geyser-ViaProxy and Geyser-Standalone feature their own basic permission handler. To edit base permissions,
open the `permissions.yml` file and add or remove permissions that Geyser players should receive when joining.
See the file for more information.

You can further customize permission handling by creating a [Geyser extension](/wiki/geyser/extensions/) that makes use of Geysers API
to deal with permission checking.

## Permissions when using Geyser on platforms without permission handlers {#permissions-platforms-no-permission-handlers}
The following affects Geyser-BungeeCord, Geyser-Velocity, and Geyser-Fabric.
These platforms unfortunately do not have built-in permission handlers. Because of that, you will need to grant permissions on those platforms
manually using permission handlers, such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/). Geyser's permission are listed above. For extension permissions, consult their documentation.

Alternatively, you can use [LuckLink](https://github.com/onebeastchris/LuckLink), a third-party Geyser extension, to automatically register permissions using [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
- Install [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) on the platform where you've installed Geyser (BungeeCord/Velocity/Fabric).
- To allow Geyser to automatically register permission defaults, install the [LuckLink](https://github.com/onebeastchris/LuckLink) Geyser extension
  by downloading the `LuckLink.jar` and adding it to Geyser's `extensions` folder.
- Restart the server, and permissions should be automatically registered.
