:::info
- Install Geyser **only** on the proxy server! You can install Floodgate on all servers for better skin support & network-wide Floodgate API availability for other plugins.   
- All servers on the network must accept <Versions platform="java"/> Java clients, as Geyser imitates one.  
:::

1. Download the plugin for your proxy software from [the download page](/download).
2. Place the Geyser jar in the `plugins` folder, and restart the server.
3. Open your Geyser config, located in `/plugins/Geyser-xyz/config.yml`, and find the following:

    ```yaml
    bedrock: 
        # The IP address that will listen for connections. 
        # Generally, you should only uncomment and change this if you want to limit what IPs can connect to your server. 
        #address: 0.0.0.0 

        # The port that will listen for connections. This is the port that Bedrock players will use to connect to your server.
        port: 19132 
    ```
    The vital part is the port. This is the port that Bedrock players will use to connect to your server!
    If you enable `clone-remote-port`, the port will be overridden and the Java port is used.
    Since you are self-hosting, you can choose the port freely - the default port is 19132.   
   **Important**: Other services/plugins that rely on ports with UDP, such as Voice Chats or Query, cannot share the port with Geyser.
     

4. Connecting to your server
        
    **Connecting locally in the same network**   
    On the same device as the server, you can connect using `localhost`, or `127.0.0.1` as the address.
    Do note: When hosting and playing on the same Windows device, you will need the [loopback fix](/wiki/geyser/fixing-unable-to-connect-to-world#using-geyser-on-the-same-computer).
    Other devices in the same local network can use your local IPv4 to connect - it starts with `10.` or `192.168.`.
        
    **Connecting from a different network**  
    You will need to expose the port Geyser runs on to the Internet if you want players from outside your network to join.
    To achieve that, you have two options:   

    - Port forwarding: Open the Geyser port (e.g. 19132) on the UDP protocol in your router/modem, and in the Windows/Linux firewall.
   [Our port forwarding guide](/wiki/geyser/port-forwarding) explains how to do this in detail.
   Then, players can connect with your public IPv4 + port to your server.   

    - playit.gg: Instead of opening a port (which might not be an option/if you do not want to expose your home ip), you can use
   the playit.gg service to create a tunnel for you to route the traffic through. See our [playit.gg guide](/wiki/geyser/playit-gg).
   Ngrok will not work since it is TCP-only.   

5. Verify whether connections from other networks are possible by running `geyser connectiontest <ip> <port>` in the console.

To allow Bedrock Edition players to join your server without needing to log in to a paid Java Edition account, you can use <a href="/wiki/floodgate/setup/">Floodgate</a>.
