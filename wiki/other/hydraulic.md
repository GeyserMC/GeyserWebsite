Hydraulic is a companion to Geyser which allows for Bedrock players to join modded Minecraft: Java Edition servers. 

## What is Hydraulic? {#what-is-hydraulic}

### Project Setup {#project-setup}

1. Clone the repo to your computer.
2. Navigate to the Hydraulic root directory and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. This command downloads all the needed submodules for Hydraulic and is a crucial step in this process.
3. The project should import into your IDE after the loom setup is complete. For more detailed information, see the [Fabric setup](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup)
4. Use `./gradlew build` to compile a jar file, or use `./gradlew :fabric:runServer` or `./gradlew :neoforge:runServer` to run a server with Hydraulic installed. Make sure to install Geyser into your `mods` folder!
