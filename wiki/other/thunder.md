Thunder is a java application to convert simple Java Edition resource packs to Bedrock Edition ones.

## What is Thunder? {#what-is-thunder}

Thunder is a converter for simple Java Edition resource packs which can generate Bedrock Edition packs, it currently converts resource packs which modifies existing vanilla assets.

:::caution

Not only is this project in early beta, it does **not** convert custom items! Please look towards [Rainbow](/wiki/other/rainbow) for that.

## Usage {#usage}

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or higher installed, if you do you should be able to open the file like a normal program.
2. Select the Java edition resource pack using the button on the left. Once you do, if it was successful you should see the icon of the pack.
3. Change the output pack name. This is the name shown to the Bedrock client.
4. Hit the convert button to start the conversion process. This step may take a while.
5. Once completed, the converter Bedrock edition resource pack will be in the same place as where your Java pack was. 
You can now either use the pack on the Bedrock client, or place it in the `packs` folder in your Geyser server.
