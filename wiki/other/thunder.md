Thunder is a java application to convert simple Java Edition resource packs to Bedrock Edition ones.

## What is Thunder? {#what-is-thunder}

Thunder is a converter for simple Java Edition resource packs which can generate Bedrock Edition packs, it currently converts resource packs which modifies existing vanilla assets.

:::caution

Not only is this project in early beta, it does **not** convert custom items! Please look towards [Rainbow](/wiki/other/rainbow) for that.

## Usage {#usage}

1. Ensure you have Java installed, if you do you should be able to open the file like a normal program.
2. Select your pack using the big button on the left. Once you do, if it was successful you should see the icon of the pack has showed up.
3. Change the output pack name to what you desire, this changes the name shown in bedrock, not the file name.
4. Hit the convert button and be patient while it converts, it may take a while.
5. Once completed, your pack should be put in the same place as where your Java pack was, you can now either use the pack on your client if your device supports adding custom packs, or place it in the `packs` folder in your Geyser server.
