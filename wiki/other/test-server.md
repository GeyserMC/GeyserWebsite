title: Test Server
description: Information about joining and using the Geyser test server.
---

### Details {#details}
- IP: `test.geysermc.org` (default ports on both Bedrock and Java)
- World size: 20k x 20k
- Nether and End disabled
- After 90 days, any untouched claimed land will be unclaimed
- After 30 days, unclaimed land will be regenerated

### Infomation {#infomation}
Geyser has a test server for those who want to test how Java \<-\> Bedrock crossplay works on their device, and to see the limitations and restrictions. You can join from either Bedrock or Java, and the server has [Floodgate](/wiki/floodgate/) installed so you don’t need a Java account to join from Bedrock.

If you can't build/destroy/interact with the world in the test server, run `/rtp` to get away from the protected spawn area.

If you have any questions or problems be sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/geysermc)!
