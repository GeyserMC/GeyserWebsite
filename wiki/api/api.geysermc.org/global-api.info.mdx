The Global API is available for every server. It currently includes: [Global Linking](/wiki/floodgate/linking/#what-is-global-linking), [skin uploading](/wiki/floodgate/features/#what-is-skin-uploading), getting a xuid by gamertag, and getting a gamertag by xuid.
We don't store anything else than you can access by the Global API, except for some non-identifiable metrics. The source code of the Global API is available [here](https://github.com/GeyserMC/global_api) and the source code of the Global Linking server is available [here](https://github.com/GeyserMC/GlobalLinkServer).

As a user of the API, you can get various info about Geyser (or specifically, Floodgate players) that joined any Geyser + Floodgate server before. This includes:
- Conversion methods from a Bedrock gamertag to Bedrock xuid, and vice-versa. Only provides info for players who are in Geyser's cache.<br />
  If you need them for all players, you can use a third-party API, e.g. https://mcprofile.io/endpoints, which also provides info from the Geyser Global API.

- Skin info: Whenever a Bedrock player joins via Floodgate, their skin gets converted & uploaded to mineskin. If you want to grab that converted skin, use the xuid of the Bedrock player in this endpoint to get a texture id, or a base64 encoded "value", which you could use directly in e.g. player heads.
