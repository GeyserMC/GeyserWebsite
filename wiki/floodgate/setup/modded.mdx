1. Download the mod from the [modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/floodgate). **Fabric servers also need the [FabricAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) mod.**
2. Place the mod jar in the `mods` folder, and restart the server.
3. Change `auth-type` in Geyser's config to `floodgate`.
4. Restart the server.

You will need to configure FabricProxyLite to allow the Fabric server to receive data from Velocity.
