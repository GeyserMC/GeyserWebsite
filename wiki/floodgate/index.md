# Overview
Floodgate is a hybrid mode plugin that allows Minecraft: Bedrock Accounts to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers without needing a Minecraft: Java Edition account. 
This is something you install in addition to Geyser. Unlike Geyser, Floodgate can only be installed as a plugin on Spigot (including Paper and forks), Bungeecord, Velocity, and as a mod on Fabric servers, and can only be utilized on servers that have it installed.

Now, the version of Floodgate is 2.0. Floodgate 2.0 is a rewrite of Floodgate 1.0, with various bugfixes and improvements. It also introduces new features: being able to [see Bedrock player skins on Java edition](/wiki/floodgate/features#what-is-skin-uploading),
being able to [use Bedrock forms](/wiki/geyser/forms/), link your account once and login on every server that has [Global Linking](/wiki/floodgate/linking#what-is-global-linking) enabled,
and the [Global Api](/wiki/api/api.geysermc.org/global-api/).
