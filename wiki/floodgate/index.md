# Overview
Floodgate is a hybrid mode plugin. It introduces new features:
- Ability to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers with Minecraft: Bedrock accounts without needing a paid Minecraft: Java Edition account. 
- Ability to [see Bedrock player skins on Java edition](/wiki/floodgate/features#what-is-skin-uploading).
- Ability for plugins to [send Bedrock forms](/wiki/geyser/forms/).
- Ability to query players through the [Global Api](/wiki/api/api.geysermc.org/global-api/), 
- Allowing Bedrock players to link to a Java account using [Global Linking](/wiki/floodgate/linking#what-is-global-linking), or Local Linking.

This is something you install in addition to Geyser. Unlike Geyser, Floodgate can only be installed as a plugin on Spigot (including Paper and forks), Bungeecord, Velocity, and as a mod on Fabric servers, and can only be utilized on servers that have it installed.
